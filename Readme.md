This project contains a GUI written in Java, and a database in SQL server. The purpose of this
Program is to store books from the point of view of a distributor. 
The original environment used SSMS for the backend and Intellij for the front end. 

To install the program on your personal machine follow this process:
1) have SSMS and Intellij installed on your machine. (Note: It would be helpful
to install Intellij Ultimate as you have database manipulation built into the IDE)
2) Open SSMS and create the database in SSMS using Bookstore_DB_Generator.sql
3) install and configure jdbc in your machine/IDE, if not already done so.
4) Import java files into Intellij (Make sure SQLConmection.java recognizes the database)
5) run GUI.java (main)
